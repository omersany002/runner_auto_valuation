It is designed to evaluate the intrinsic value of RunnerAuto based on its future cash flow projections and the present value principle. The model is structured into several key components, each located on a separate sheet within the workbook. Below is an overview of each sheet and its purpose:

## Sheets Overview

- **Assumptions**: This sheet contains all the key assumptions used throughout the valuation model, including growth rates, discount rates, and other financial metrics. Users should review and adjust these assumptions as needed to reflect the most accurate and current information.

- **Proforma Income Statement**: A detailed projection of RunnerAuto's income statement over the next few years, derived from the assumptions sheet. It includes revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), operating expenses, and net income.
